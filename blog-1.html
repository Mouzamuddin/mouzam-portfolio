            <h3>Python Features</h3>
            <br> Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br> Interpreted Language: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar
            to PERL and PHP.<br> Object-Oriented Language: Python supports the Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.<br> Free and Open Source<br> Cross-platform Language (Portable): Python can run on
            a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.<br> Powerful
            <br> Large Standard Library<br> Databases: Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.<br> GUI Programming: Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems,
            such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of UNIX.<br> Integrated: It can be easily integrated with C, C++ and Java.<br>
