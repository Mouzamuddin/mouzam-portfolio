    <h1 style="text-align: centers;">  My journey to react js  </h1>
    <div>
        This article is a bit long, believe me, after completing you’ll get started with React JS right away. Honestly, I wasted a lot of my time searching for the best material to get started. Watched Tons of YouTube videos never completed one,<br> because
        I was not aware of the fundamental prerequisites (checklist) of React.js. In this article, I’m going to take you through the journey of how I learned React JS from scratch by starting Plain(vanilla)
        HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT (beginner level) at Neog level zero and also no prior experience in any frontend frameworks like Angular, Vue, etc., Understand this first, React is completely on JavaScript, the more you practice JavaScript the better
        you learn React. For now, basic JavaScript is enough to get started.
        <br>
        <br>
    
        <h3>Checklist/Prerequisites:</h3>
   
        <h3>the below Checklist is mandatory, make sure you tick all the items to understand any React JS tutorial.</h3>
        <h4>1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Fundamentals to get started).</h4>
        <h4>2. Some ES6 concepts of JavaScript like -
            <h4>1. Arrow Functions</h4>
            <h4>2. Let and Const</h4>
            <h4>3. Class and ‘this’ keyword</h4>
            <h4>3. Node.js (Fundamentals)</h4>
            You don’t have to know it completely at the beginning, just concentrate on the fundamentals which I’ll tell you below.
            <h>4. Code-Editor (code sandbox would be a lot easier as it has React environment predefined).</h4><br>
                <br>
    
        <h3>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT:</h3><br>
        <h3>Skip this topic if you are not new to Html, CSS, JS.</h3><br>
     <br>
        . These three are the foundations of frontend web development.<br> · They work together to create a fully functional web app/website.<br> · Consider a Human body as a website or web app<br> · HTML — Defines the structure which is the “Skeleton”,
        tells what has to come where.<br> · CSS — Defines the style which is the “Skin, Flesh”, tells how a particular segment should look like what should be its Colour, Height, Width, etc.,<br> · JS — Defines the functionality which is the “Brain”
        not exactly the brain but the part of the brain which tells each of the parts to do what.<br> · I think that’s enough to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a web application or website.<br>
        <br>
        <h4>Some ES6 concepts of Javascript:</h4>
        <br>
        Arrow Function, Let and Const, Class and ‘this’ keyword The JavaScript in our browser keeps on changing, ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 if I put it in simple words it is just another version of JavaScript.<br> There are lots of new features in ES6
        but for now to get started with React we just need to know about Arrow Functions, Let and Const, Class and ‘this’ keyword.<br>

        <h4>
            Functions:
        </h4>

        Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.<br> Check out the below snippet to understand better.
        <br> <br>
        <br>//The old wayfunction greet()<br> {

        <br> console.log('Hello');
        <br> }var greet1 = function(){<br> console.log('hello');
        <br> }//The ES6 wayvar greet2 = () => {<br> console.log('hello');
        <br> }
        <br>
        <br> Watch this video <br> <br>Let and Const:<br><br> In simple words<br> · Let — is used to define a local variable limiting their scope to the block in which they are declared.<br> · Const — is used to define a constant variable whose values
        cannot be changed.<br> Class and ‘this’ keyword:<br> Object-Oriented Programming concepts like Class, Method, Objects were introduced in ES6.<br> Class objects are just like those classes and objects we’ve learned in other languages like C++,
        Java.
        <br> have a look at the code below<br> Now let’s talk about the ‘this’ keyword:<br> ‘this’ — keyword represents the current object in execution.<br> a firm understanding of the ‘this’ keyword is highly recommended along with that learn what
        is Bind (used to bind /connect the ‘this’ keyword to an object).<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        Node JS fundamentals to understand React JS code.<br>
        <h4>What is Node JS? (in Plain English)</h4>
        Node is an execution environment for JavaScript it’s not a programming language, every browser has a JavaScript engine for example chrome has a V8 engine,<br> Mozilla Firefox has Spider Monkey, Microsoft Edge has Chakra these engines are embedded
        into browsers, they cannot perform any operation outside the browser like File operations, <br> OS operations, Network Operations, to overcome that Node is made. The V8 engine is embedded inside the Node Js. so Node is a JavaScript engine
        that can do File, OS, <br> Network operation and has chrome’s V8 engine embedded inside of it. Node work outside of the browser.<br> Ok, now what are all the Features of Node you must know to learn React<br>
        <h4>
            1. NPM(Node Package Manager)</h4>
        It is a package manager to install external node modules and packages to your project just like PIP for python.<br>
        <h4>
            2. IMPORT and EXPORT keywords.</h4>
        Import — after installing a node module using NPM in your project, to use that module in your code you use ‘import’.<br> Export — is used when you are creating a module/component and want to return only a part, not all the methods and variables.<br>            Those two above mentioned concepts of Node Js are good enough to get started with React JS.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            CODE EDITORS</h3>
        A better selection of code editor helps a lot during development.<br> For Web development the most recommended code editors are<br> 1. Visual Studio Code — VS CODE — Highly recommended.<br> 2. Sublime Text<br> 3. Atom<br> Checklist Done</p>
        <br>
        <h3> React JS</h3>
        Now let’s talk about React and things to learn first.<br> What is React JS?<br> React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive User Interfaces.<br> React follows Component architecture, which means every part of a
        web app or website is a component, all are made separately and finally fitted into a parent component which is then rendered.<br>
        <br> Now things to learn first in React JS:<br> 1. Component architecture (already done).<br> 2. State<br> 3. Props<br> 4. Functional Components, Class Components.<br> 5. Styling(CSS) in React.<br> 6. React Routing.<br> those are the basic
        concepts of React, once you complete those you’ll start to feel confident about React.<br>
        <br>
        <h4>State and Props (in Plain English):</h4>
        State — to put in simple terms ‘state’ holds synchronous variables, as if you change the value of a state variable then the change is reflected immediately in all the places that particular variable is used.<br> Props — are just like arguments
        passed in a function or method, in here props(arguments) are passed into an Html tag as input argument.<br> That’s Pretty much all I figured in my journey.
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3><br> Thank you for reading this, I hope you find this article helpful and get started with React JS and Web development.<br>
